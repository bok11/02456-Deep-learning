    "It often happens that you have a combination of data that cannot fully be modeled by any one of these three types of network. Knowing how to divide the data into the right subsets, and then build a network that handles each subset efficiently can mean the difference between a great model and an unusable one. \n",

    "The dataset consists approximately 1,584 images of leaf specimens (16 samples each of 99 species) which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. \n",
    "Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a ﬁne-scale margin histogram. For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.\n",

    "We will primarily look into the type of neural network best suited for handling this type of data. \n",

    " * For the describing features a FFN is often a good option\n",
